🛡️ JACOBI AI Security Policy

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: march 1, 2025

1️⃣ Overview

JACOBI AI is a classified, military-grade artificial intelligence system designed for secure, edge-based deployment in contested environments. This security policy outlines strict access controls, encryption standards, operational security (OPSEC), and compliance requirements to prevent unauthorized modification, cloning, or exploitation of the system.

2️⃣ Access Control & Authentication

🔒 2.1 Restricted Access
	•	JACOBI AI is a closed-source, non-public system. No unauthorized access is permitted.
	•	Only pre-approved individuals (e.g., designated military personnel, vetted engineers) may access JACOBI AI under strict NDA agreements.

🔐 2.2 Multi-Layer Authentication

All access must be authenticated through:
	1.	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (hardware keys, biometric verification).
	2.	Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) (continuous verification of user identity).
	3.	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit user permissions.

🚫 2.3 No Unauthorized Modifications
	•	All modifications must be reviewed, cryptographically signed, and logged.
	•	Any unauthorized modification attempts will trigger immediate alerts and lockdown procedures.

3️⃣ Encryption & Data Security

🔑 3.1 Code & Data Encryption
	•	JACOBI AI’s source code, AI models, and sensitive data are encrypted with:
	•	AES-256 encryption for data at rest.
	•	TLS 1.3 / QUIC encryption for data in transit.
	•	Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for privacy-preserving AI computations.

🚫 3.2 Preventing Code Theft & Reverse Engineering
	•	Binary obfuscation and anti-tamper measures are implemented in compiled versions.
	•	AI models are stored in encrypted containers, requiring cryptographic authentication for decryption.
	•	No public API keys or credentials are embedded in code repositories.

4️⃣ Infrastructure Security

🔥 4.1 Private, Air-Gapped Deployment
	•	JACOBI AI operates in air-gapped, high-security environments when required.
	•	No direct internet access except through monitored, encrypted communication channels.

📡 4.2 Secure Network Architecture
	•	Mesh Networking + Zero Trust Security for battlefield resilience.
	•	No reliance on third-party cloud services (unless controlled via private defense networks).

🚫 4.3 Blocking External Code Execution
	•	JACOBI AI rejects all unauthorized script execution to prevent remote code injection.
	•	AI models are locked with digital signatures to verify authenticity before execution.

5️⃣ Compliance & Ethical Safeguards

📜 5.1 Compliance with Military & International Standards
	•	JACOBI AI follows:
	•	U.S. DoD AI Ethical Principles
	•	International Humanitarian Law (IHL)
	•	NIST Cybersecurity Framework

👁️ 5.2 Blockchain-Based Auditing
	•	Every AI decision is logged immutably via blockchain verification, ensuring transparency and preventing unauthorized actions.
	•	Regular audits are conducted to detect anomalies, vulnerabilities, or unauthorized access attempts.

🛡️ 5.3 Human-in-the-Loop Governance
	•	AI-driven decisions involving lethal force or strategic deployments must be verified by authorized personnel before execution.

6️⃣ Incident Response & Breach Protocols

🚨 6.1 Immediate Response to Unauthorized Access
	•	Automatic system lockdown if unauthorized access is detected.
	•	Self-healing mechanisms activate to isolate compromised nodes.
	•	Incident response team (IRT) notified in real-time.

🛠 6.2 Code Integrity Checks
	•	SHA-256 hash verifications run before system updates to prevent backdoors.
	•	Regular penetration testing & red team exercises ensure security resilience.
