# JACOBI AI: A Secure, Adaptive Military Artificial Intelligence System

## Overview

Welcome to JACOBI AI, a cutting-edge military-grade artificial intelligence system designed for deployment on edge devices in contested battlefield environments. JACOBI integrates advanced machine learning, swarm intelligence, and secure cryptographic protocols to enable real-time tactical decision-making, autonomous operations, and ethical governance. This project leverages state-of-the-art technologies, including Homomorphic Encryption (HE) with the CKKS scheme and Secure Federated Learning (SFL) with PySyft, to ensure privacy, security, and scalability for military applications.

JACOBI AI is mission-ready, supporting operations such as battlefield scanning, drone swarms, and intelligence sharing among allied forces, while adhering to International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) AI Ethics Principles. Developed by AnubisQuantumCipher, this project represents a significant advancement in military AI research and deployment.

## Features

- **Online Learning**: Adapts to new battlefield data in real time using incremental learning, minimizing latency and resource use.
- **Self-Healing Swarm**: A network of edge nodes (drones, vehicles, soldier gear) dynamically redistributes tasks, ensuring operational continuity under node failures.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provides granular, human-level explanations using SHAP, supporting tactical decision-making and ethical audits.
- **Real-Time Adaptability**: Prioritizes low-latency inference with lightweight models, dynamic simulations, and context-aware tuning.
- **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)**: Implements CKKS via TenSEAL for secure voting, health checks, and federated learning, preserving privacy on encrypted data.
- **Secure Federated Learning (SFL)**: Uses PySyft for privacy-preserving model updates across distributed nodes, with differential privacy to prevent data leakage.
- **Ethical Governance**: Ensures compliance with IHL and DoD AI Ethics Principles through real-time ethical checks and human oversight.
- **Edge Optimization**: Employs binary neural networks, TensorRT, and mesh networking for deployment on low-power, rugged devices.

## Installation and Setup

To run JACOBI AI locally (on a computer, as iPhones cannot run Python natively), follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Required libraries (install via pip):

```bash
pip install tenseal syft torch transformers numpy matplotlib
```

### Cloning the Repository
1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
2. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnubisQuantumCipher/JacobiAI.git
cd JacobiAI
```

### Running JACOBI AI
1. Save the `jacobi_ai.py` file from this repository into the `JacobiAI` folder.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python jacobi_ai.py
```

3. Interact with JACOBI via command-line input or the FastAPI interface (see below).

### FastAPI Interface
JACOBI includes a FastAPI web interface for remote command processing:
- Run the script to start the server on `http://0.0.0.0:8443`.
- Access it via `GET /command/{input}` with a valid military authentication token (configured in `config.json` or environment variables).

## Configuration
- Create a `config.json` file in the project root with the following structure:

```json
{
  "mongodb_uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
  "mqtt_host": "military-hq.mqtt",
  "mqtt_topic": "military/intelligence",
  "security_target": "battlefield-server",
  "vision_model": "yolov8n.pt",
  "salt_path": "salt.bin"
}
```

- Set the `JACOBI_PASSWORD` and `MILITARY_API_TOKEN` secrets in a secure vault or environment variables (e.g., via `SecretsManager`).

## Usage
JACOBI processes battlefield commands via text or voice input, providing tactical recommendations, XAI explanations, and swarm coordination. Example commands include:

- `scan battlefield`: Scans for open ports and threats.
- `deploy drones`: Initiates autonomous drone operations with real-time adjustments.
- `detect targets`: Identifies and prioritizes targets with ethical oversight.

Output includes AI responses, tactical breakdowns, command assistance, and war game simulations, all encrypted and secure.

## Architecture
JACOBI consists of:
- **CommandProcessor**: Handles NLP, XAI, ethics, and learning with HE and SFL.
- **OptimizedAgent**: Manages edge-optimized models (YOLO, Whisper) with TensorRT and binary networks.
- **JacobiAI**: Orchestrates swarm operations, HE voting, and SFL updates.
- **KeyManager**: Manages quantum-resistant and homomorphic encryption keys.
- **ResourceManager**: Dynamically allocates CPU/GPU resources with adaptive prioritization.
